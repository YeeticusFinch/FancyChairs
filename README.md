# FancyChairs

FancyChairs is a plugin that adds the ability to make chairs and to sit on them.

A chair is a staircase or a slab that has a carpet on it.

Right click a carpet on a slab or a stair to place the carpet on it.

This plugin can be configured to disable the carpets, or to allow players to sit on staircases and slabs without carpets. And it can also be configured to require both hands to be empty to sit on a staircase or slab.

To remove all fancy chairs (the armorstands that hold the carpet): 
- `/kill @e[tag=FancyChair]`

To remove all seats (the armorstand that the player actually rides, one of these is created whenever a player sits on a block, and it gets reused if that block has been sat on):
- `/kill @e[tag=TempChair]`
